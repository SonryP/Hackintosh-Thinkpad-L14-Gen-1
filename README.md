<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>


- Sleep and Wake needs extended testing. From closing the lid to actual sleeping it takes around 20 seconds. I had no problems with waking from sleep or hibernation for now
- A Broadcom Wi-Fi card is recommended.
- Battery life isn't quite up to spec. I suspect it is because of the CFG Lock, which cannot be disabled without BIOS modding (requires hardware). Battery patching is handled dynamically by ECEnabler, haven't had problems for now.
- HDMI works but needs extensive patching: External displays stop working after sleep or reboot, replugging fixes the issue but is far from ideal. Still, it is enough to get by. I'm working on this but if you've got a fix please report an issue. (Not tested on the update)


- USB-C fully tested (Thunderbolt3, DP, SuperSpeed Combo)
- DSDT Patches may need cleanup.
- Touchpad gestures now work using VoodooRMI, though I experienced erratic tracking at various times, mostly after sleep. Nothing major: tracking can get jumpy and palm rejection kicks in sometimes. Tolerable, but far from ideal. I already opened an issue in its GitHub repo.

# Initial setup
You NEED to supply your own SMBIOS, Serial number, MLB and UUID using GenSMBIOS, configured for a MacbookPro16,3
